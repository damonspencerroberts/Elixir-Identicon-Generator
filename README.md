# Ident -> Identicon Generator

### This is a project for the Elixir Bootcamp by Stephen Grider on Udemy

**This is an Identicon Generator**

When you first sign up for github you are given an identicon, which
is unique to every username. It takes a string as an input and creates a unique shaped image that is symetrical.

This app takes a string as input in the main function and outputs the identicon image as a png file in the root of the project.
